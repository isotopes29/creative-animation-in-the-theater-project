Used ChatGPT AI to debug my code. in the startingScene() method, when I inputted the last name, it resulted in the not-found message. chatgpt was INCOMPETENT and DIDNT FIX THE PROBLEM
so i just got rid of the not found message entirely and added it to the starter message instead
which told the user to try again if it didnt work
